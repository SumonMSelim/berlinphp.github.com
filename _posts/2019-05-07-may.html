                  <h4>Symfony Flex - Reloaded</h4>

    {% comment %} SUB-TITLE OR DESCRIPTION:                   {% endcomment %}
                  <p>
                      Since the start of Symfony Flex several things changed. I will give you a short 
                      overview about Symfony Flex, the features and why it is cool to use it! In the 
                      end, we will create our own recipe and have a look at the different possibilities 
                      to publish recipes.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Consumer-Driven Contract Testing</h4>

    {% comment %} SUB-TITLE OR DESCRIPTION:                   {% endcomment %}
                  <p>What are contracts? Who are my consumers? Does my service solves problems as requested?<br>
                      Reliable communication paths between applications are key in a distributed service architechture.<br>
                      While more and more agility leads to evolution and transformation of software and products, it is still required to keep an eye on compatibility and consumer requirements ...but what if they change?<br>
                      I would like to introduce you this powerful framework and show you how it can help to ensure the development of sustainable APIs.</p>
